I designed the website using figma,for both mobile and desktop screen.
The frontend was simple and did not need much state management so I used Vanilla Javascript ❤️
and styled it using Tailwindcss (served using cdn just to simplify)
For the backend the love for go's speed and simplicity made me go for pocketbase (BaaS),to serve
the expertise,projects,skills and frequently asked quiz data that I will be updating regularly.It also stores information from
the message form that users submit.

The choice of the above technologies made the site really simple,optimised and responsive for all screen sizes.

You can clone the repository and run it it,no dependancies needed for the frontend,just the tailwindcss which is also served through CDN.  
Backend, you might need to setup your own pocketbase (I used pockethost.io to host it) to serve data and
store information.The figma file I used is also included.

I have not included all my projects cause some are still in progress and am also currently building
an LMS using MERN stack which I will deploy and add to the projects section once am done with it.
